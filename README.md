## Features

* User can select favorite Superhero / Villain from the dropdown list (retrieved via API/AJAX 'GET' request) which will then load an image of the selected hero/villain and a random programming joke.
* User can choose to see a random joke instead of selecting from the dropdown menu.
* User can opt to create a meme for their favorite hero/villain instead of seeing a joke.
* Fully optimized to be responsive for mobile, tablet and desktop access.
* API GET request limited to 1/s to avoid spam/abuse of the API request.
